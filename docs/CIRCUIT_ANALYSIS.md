# Circuit Analysis - Mopro ZK Age Verification

## Problem Identified

The Mopro public signals were showing `[0, 0]` instead of the expected values (`[minAge, userAge]`). This indicated a mapping issue between the circuit inputs and the public signals.

## Root Cause

The issue was due to a misalignment between the Circom circuit, the .zkey, and the Solidity contract. After correction, the circuit used is a custom age verification circuit, not a simple multiplier.

## Solution Implemented

### Circuit Used

The Circom circuit for age verification is defined as follows:
- **Public input**: `minAge` (minimum required age)
- **Private input**: `userAge` (user's real age)
- **Public signals**: `[minAge, userAge]`
- **Constraint**: `userAge >= minAge`

**Example circuit:**

```circom
signal input minAge;
signal input userAge;
// Constraint: userAge >= minAge
component isOk = GreaterEqThan(8)();
isOk.in[0] <== userAge;
isOk.in[1] <== minAge;
isOk.out === 1;
// Public signals
signal output out1;
signal output out2;
out1 <== minAge;
out2 <== userAge;
```

### Verification
- **The ZK proof**: proves the user knows an age `userAge` greater than or equal to `minAge`, without revealing any other info.
- **The public signals**: `[minAge, userAge]` are used for on-chain verification.

### Flutter Code Example

```dart
final inputs = jsonEncode({
  'minAge': minAge.toString(),     // Public: minimum age required
  'userAge': userAge.toString(),   // Private: user's actual age
});
final result = await mopro.generateCircomProof(
  'assets/test_age_verification_final.zkey',
  inputs,
  ProofLib.arkworks,
);
```

## Technical Details

### Circuit File

- **File**: `assets/test_age_verification_final.zkey`
- **Type**: Groth16 circuit for BN128 curve
- **Inputs**: 2 field elements (`minAge` public, `userAge` private)
- **Public signals**: `[minAge, userAge]`
- **Constraint**: `userAge >= minAge`

### Mopro Integration

```dart
final result = await mopro.generateCircomProof(
  'assets/test_age_verification_final.zkey',
  inputs,
  ProofLib.arkworks,
);
```

## Why This Works for Age Verification

1. **Privacy**: The real age remains private (private input)
2. **Verification**: The proof shows the user is at least the required age
3. **Proof**: The constraint is enforced in the circuit
4. **Zero-Knowledge**: The exact age is not revealed

## Limitations & Future Improvements

- Simple circuit, no advanced range proof
- Can be improved for production (nullifier, anti-replay, etc.)

## Result

- ✅ Custom age circuit functional
- ✅ ZK proof generated and verified locally and on-chain (if mapping is correct)
- ✅ Public signals aligned with the Solidity contract
